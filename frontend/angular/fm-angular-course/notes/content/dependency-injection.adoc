# Dependency Injection (a design pattern)

What is dependency? +
This is a service or object that is needed for a class to perform some function

## DI Providers
There are 3 types of providers: 

* Class based providers
* Value providers
* Factory providers

## DI how to use?
* Class based + 
To inject a class based dependency(service) we have to add it inside the controller of the component

[source, typescript]
----
  import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
  import { ApiService } from '../../apiService/api.service';
  import Product from 'src/app/interfaces/product.interface';

  @Injectable({
    providedIn: 'root' // this means that this is resolved in app.modules.ts file
  })
  export class ProductsApiServiceService {

    constructor(private apiService: ApiService<Product>) { }
  }
----

Ok now we can use the apiSerivce in our component/other service and this is example of the most popular provider which is class based. That means normal service


* Factory - We use factory providers to inject already existing services to our angular project. For eg. local storage. In separate file we use sth like this: +
[source, typescript]
----
  import {InjectionToken} from '@angular/core'

  export const LocalStorageToken = new InjectionToken<any>('local storage', {
    providedIn: 'root',
    factory() {
      return localStorage;
    }
  })
